To connect your local Git repository to a remote repository (for example, on GitHub), you can use the `git remote add origin` command followed by the URL of the remote repository. Hereâ€™s the syntax:

```bash
git remote add origin <https://github.com/MalaikaArif5/<Css_-pH_scale class="git"></Css_-pH_scale>>
```
  

### Example

If you have created a new repository on GitHub, your command might look like this:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

### Steps after adding remote origin

1. **Verify the remote is set correctly:**
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

2. **Push your local changes to the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main  # Replace 'main' with your branch name if it's different
   ```

Now your local repository is connected to the remote repository, and you can push and pull changes as needed. If you have any further questions or need assistance with specific tasks, feel free to ask!
